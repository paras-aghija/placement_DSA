/*
	Given a set of cities and distance between every pair of
	cities, the problem is to find the shortest possible route
	that visits every city exactly once and returns to the
	starting point.

	Note the difference between Hamiltonian Cycle and TSP.
	The Hamiltoninan cycle problem is to find if there exist
	a tour that visits every city exactly once. Here we know
	that Hamiltonian Tour exists (because the graph is complete) and in fact many such tours exist, the problem is to find a minimum weight Hamiltonian Cycle.

	TSP: Min wt hamiltonian cycle
